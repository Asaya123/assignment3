        <p>The Pantheon in Rome is one of the best-preserved monuments of ancient Rome and a true marvel of architectural ingenuity. Originally built as a temple for all gods of ancient Rome, the current structure was commissioned by Emperor Hadrian and completed around AD 126. It was constructed on the site of an earlier Pantheon built by Marcus Agrippa during the reign of Augustus.</p>

        <p>The Pantheon is particularly famous for its massive dome, which remains the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world. At its center is the oculus, a 9-meter-wide circular opening that allows natural light to illuminate the interior. This ingenious design reduces the weight of the dome while also creating a breathtaking visual effect.</p>

        <p>The structure combines elements of traditional Greek temple design with revolutionary Roman engineering. The front facade features a classical portico with large Corinthian columns, while the main rotunda showcases an awe-inspiring harmony of space and proportion. The interior originally housed statues of various Roman gods, but after the rise of Christianity, the building was consecrated as a church in AD 609, dedicated to St. Mary and the Martyrs.</p>

        <p>Over the centuries, the Pantheon has been in continuous use, which has helped preserve its grandeur. During the Renaissance, it became a significant cultural landmark, and several notable figures, including the painter Raphael, were buried inside. The building has also influenced numerous architectural works worldwide, inspiring the design of domed structures such as the U.S. Capitol and St. Peter's Basilica.</p>

        <p>Today, the Pantheon stands as a symbol of Rome’s architectural brilliance and its enduring cultural legacy. It remains a popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year. Whether admired for its engineering mastery, historical significance, or spiritual atmosphere, the Pantheon continues to be a defining symbol of ancient Rome’s greatness.</p>

        <p>Visitors to Rome can experience the Pantheon’s grandeur firsthand, walking through its vast interior, gazing up at the oculus, and feeling the connection between the past and present within its timeless walls.</p>
